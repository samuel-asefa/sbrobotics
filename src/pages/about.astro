                <p>While building a robot may sound very much like it may only be for individuals with specific technical abilities, the truth is that the real success stories come from highly motivated teams with varying talents. This is a very rigorous program that requires tremendous dedication and several thousands of hours outside of school including weekends, breaks, and days off.

                  The VEX Robotics Competition tasks teams of students with designing and building a robot to play against other teams from around the world in a game-based engineering challenge. Classroom STEM concepts are put to the test on the playing field as students learn lifelong skills in teamwork, leadership, communication, and more. Tournaments are held year-round at the regional, state, and national levels; local champions go on to compete against the best in the world at the VEX Robotics World Championship each May!
